to run js code you can do so in a terminal 
       node fileName e.g node test to run test.js file

we can use modules in node
we can run a file in another file using require('path')

we can create ,write and delete files in js
we can also create and delete directories in js
the call module for this is fs standing for file system


to manage 3rd party packkages we use npm node package manager


to avoid restarting server each time we can install a package called nodemon globally npm install -g nodemon 
then to run a server and enable auto restarts instead of node filename use nodemon filename



express allows us to easily manage our routing

EJS (Embedded JavaScript): A popular templating engine with support for embedding JavaScript code within templates.


always remember when you find yourself repeating code there is something you are not doing right
we can avoid repeating using partials
example in the practice files the nav and headers were repeating so 
you create a partials folder in the views in it create individal files of repeating codes with ejs extension
to include the code where needed use
              <%- include('./partials/nav.ejs')%>
<%=%> leaves out special characters
not repeating also makes editing easy
